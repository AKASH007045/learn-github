# Course Overview
1. Key Concept
2. Setup
3. Project Initialise
4. Working locally
5. Working on github

## Git : is distribuuted and de-centralised Source Control system. However it could be centralised.
Under Git we version snapshot not versioning specific files and folders

### Commits : are saved changes to Git repositories. These are uniquely identified by sha1 hash.
### Branches : are timeline with commit. Default is master/main.
### Head: is pointer to last commit on current branch
### remote: pointer to remote repository. (Not local)

## Git Workflow : 

init >>  work >> stage changes using add command >> commit changes in staging area using commit command >> push to remote repo using push command --> pull down is require to see others changes

> Files must pass through Git's staging area before being committed.
> Git's staging area is sometimes referred to as the index

## Git Configuration
git config --global user.name "Akash Sharma"
git config --global user.email "akash007XX@gmail.com"
git config --global --list

## Workflow
git init >> create a new file >> git status (Initial commit, untracked files present, nothing added to commit) use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory) or git checkout -- <filename> to discard changes in working directory.

git add >>  git status (Initial commit, changes to be commited) // use "git rm cached <file>" (to unstage) // its currently in staging area or "git reset head <filename>" to unstage or use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage

git commit -m "first commit" (nothing to commit, working directory clean)

## Going Remote
### Setting up SSH Authentication
Generating an SSH Key

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your.name@your-company.com"
Use your actual email address in the example above.

Add SSH public key to the Github
Paste the public key on Github

Sign in to Github Account
Goto Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH Key
Paste your copied public key and give it a Title of your choice.

Verify SSH authentication

ssh -T git@github.com
Above command uses ssh to connect to GitHub over the SSH protocol.
