Git : is distribuuted and Centralised Source Control system. However it cold be centralised.
Under Git we version snapshot not versioning specific files and folders
Commits : are saved changes to Git repositories. These are uniquely identified by sha1 hash.

Branches : are timeline with commit. Default is master.
Head: is pointer to last commit on current branch
remote: pointer to remote repository. (Not local)

Git Workflow : 

init >>  work >> stage changes using add command >> commit changes in staging area using commit command >> push to remote repo using push command --> pull down is require to see others changes

### Git Configuration
git config --global user.name "Akash Sharma"
git config --global user.email "akash007XX@gmail.com"
git config --global --list

## Workflow
git init >> create a new file >> git status (Initial commit, untracked files present, nothing added to commit)
git add >>  git status (Initial commit, changes to be commited) // use git rm cached <file> (to unstage) // its currently in staging area
git commit -m "first commit" (nothing to commit, working directory clean)
